# Bravissimo Task

This is a simple application to demonstrate my use of HTML, Javascript and Node.js.

The application simulates a very basic store and basket set up, where the user can view all products, view product pages, add products to their basket, view the basket and edit and remove products from within their basket.

# Data Store

I used a mock database by including the data in a json file in the data folder. However, I hosted this on a node server to demonstrate my use of Node.js.

# With more time

As I am used to coding in dart/flutter and using firebase, swithcing to html, javascript and node.js was new, and so initally getting to grips with it took some time.

My plan was to then use an external database and SQL instead of this json file.

The user's basket is currently only connected to a map within local storage. With more time I would have connected this to a persistent data store with Node.js along with the product data.
