# Bravissimo Task

This is a simple application to demonstrate my use of HTML, Javascript and Node.js.

The application simulates a very basic store and basket set up, where the user can view all products, search for products, view product pages, add products to their basket, view the basket and edit and remove products from within their basket.

# Data Store

I used a mock database for the products by including the data in a json file in the data folder. However, I hosted this on a node server to demonstrate my use of Node.js.

# Versions

node version - v20.11.1
npm version - v10.2.4

# Accessing the Application

1. Project is hosted at `http://localhost:3000/`.
2. Start the application by running npm start
3. You may need to refresh the browser page after the server has fully started to load the application correctly.
